 In the project, the user can look up an NBA player. Then, the user can see the player’s statistics for the season, and, if the player plays during that day, the user can see the player’s over/under odds in sportsbooks for three statistics (points, rebounds, and assists) and a prediction on whether or not the player will get that line. 

The user should run the "main.py" file to run the program. The project will require the following libraries: cmu_graphics, selenium, pillow, and pandas.
